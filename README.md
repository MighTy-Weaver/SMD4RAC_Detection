# AC-Detection-Validation

This repository is the second phase of
project [Inefficient-AC-detection](https://github.com/MighTy-Weaver/Inefficient-AC-detection).

We aim to validate our result by carrying out the experiment again using various deep-learning algorithms, explain them,
and find some consistency in between.

Currently, candidate algorithms are:

- [ ] LSTM
- [ ] CNN
- [ ] RNN
- [ ] MLP
- [ ] SVM
- [ ] Linear Repressor

More to be updated.

Meanwhile, explaining various algorithms left to be a problem.

We can actually explain the algorithms based on each one of them.
