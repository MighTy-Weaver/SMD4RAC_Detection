## 3. Data Compilation

***Due to the privacy issues, the dataset will not be made open to public.***

However, we provide a 200
lines [sample version](https://github.com/MighTy-Weaver/Inefficient-AC-detection/blob/main/demo/sample_data.csv) of the
full dataset to demonstrate the formation of our experimenting data, and you can check the `data_compilation.py` for how
our data is compiled from different categories of data.

*Remarks: Please notice that the `Location` in `sample_data.csv` are set to 0 for privacy.*
