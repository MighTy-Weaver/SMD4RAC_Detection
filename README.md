# AC-Detection-Validation

This repository is the second phase of
project [Inefficient-AC-detection](https://github.com/MighTy-Weaver/Inefficient-AC-detection).

We aim to conduct more empirical research by leveraging advanced supervised learning techniques.

First phase will focus on Contrastive Learning, as shown
in [this folder](https://github.com/MighTy-Weaver/AC-Detection-Validation/tree/main/ContrastiveLearning).
